# The Doors #

## About: ##  
The Doors is a never-seen-before, profound and unique experience that contains an unorthodox atmosphere that becomes evident in its many Menu interactions. It's a **Multiplayer menu** that allows many servers to be created and joined over a network. In addition, it has an abundance of in-game options that can customize your experience such as: Window Mode, Resolution, Max FPS, Vsync, Gamma and Volume. When **Hosting a server**, you can **Create a name**, select whether it's **Public** or **Private** as well as the **Max players** that the server can hold (2 - 4 players). Inside the **Lobby Menu**, you are able to **see how many players are in the server** through a **Player List** and if you are the host, you can **select between 1 of 3 maps** (Red_Map, Green_Map or Blue_Map). So what are you waiting for, Enter **'The Doors'** Now!
